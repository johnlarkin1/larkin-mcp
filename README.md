Slight lie with the photo though is that the Typescript version is that I did scope that one.... so it's actually `bunx @johnlarkin1/larkin-mcp`  rather than just `bunx larkin-mcp`. I talk about why I did this in the blog.

# larkin-mcp

This is going to be a MCP connector that runs it's tools locally over stdio and makes no external connections. The goal is that you'll be able to download it, use Claude Desktop / ChatGPT / Claude Code and integrate and ask questions.... about me. So a smidge egotistical I suppose, but I want to get some more reps in with doing this.

Alrighty so this is largely going to be for me and because I'm getting sick of how much I'm using all the AI tooling, so want to make sure I still flex the skills. I'm gonna be disabling Cursor for the entirety of this repo.

## motivation

I want to have the same MCP server across Python, Typescript, and Rust. so you can check out the various subdirs. `uv` and `cargo` and `bun` given Anthropic's recent acquisition I feel like I might as well use it.
